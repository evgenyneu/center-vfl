# Centering a view in a super view with visual format language using Auto Layout in iOS/Swift

This is an example of centeing a label in its view using [Visual Format Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/VisualFormatLanguage/VisualFormatLanguage.html). Tested in iOS 7, 8 and 9.

Here is the code from [view controller](https://github.com/evgenyneu/center-vfl/blob/master/CenteringWithVFL/ViewController.swift) that does the trick:

```Swift
// Center vertically
var constraints = NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormat(
  "V:[superview]-(<=1)-[label]",
  options: NSLayoutFormatOptions.AlignAllCenterX,
  metrics: nil,
  views: ["superview":view, "label":label])

view.addConstraints(constraints)

// Center horizontally
constraints = NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormat(
  "H:[superview]-(<=1)-[label]",
  options: NSLayoutFormatOptions.AlignAllCenterY,
  metrics: nil,
  views: ["superview":view, "label":label])

view.addConstraints(constraints)
```

## How it works

This code is something like special theory of relativity. I can not say I completely understand it. But it seems to work.

We use two visual format strings:

1. `@"V:[superview]-(<=1)-[label]"` with `AlignAllCenterX` option
1. `@"H:[superview]-(<=1)-[label]"` with `AlignAllCenterY` option

It aligns X and Y centres of the label and its superview. The `(<=1)` inequality constraints are needed to allow those centering constraints do their job. If we had just `[superview][label]` it would **probably** stick the edges of the label and its superview together.
